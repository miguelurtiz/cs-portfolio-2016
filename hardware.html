       <font size= "6"><p> One of the most Important and Mandatory components of any sort of computer is the Motherboard. The Motherboard is basically the brain/heart of any computer and helps it function properly. The motherboard has different slots and sockets that can connect to the computer, so it's very necessary to make sure that the motherboard is paired with the correct computer model. </p></font>
       <font size= "6"><p> History: During the late 1980's, people thought that it was more sufficient to place all of the functions of a computer into a motherboard and then place the motherboard in the computer itself, while also including different slots and sockets for wires to connect to it. </p></font>

       <font size= "6"><p> The CPU, also known as the Central-Processing Unit, is a component found in a computer that helps give instructions on how a computer should function. The CPU has the trait of programmability, in which you are able to program the main computer with the CPU. The CPU is mainly like the Brain of a computer because it helps tell the computer what to do. </p></font>
       <font size= "6"><p> History: In the late 1940's, CPU's were used for larger and specific computers at that time.</p></font>

       <font size= "6"><p> RAM, also known as Random-Access Memory, is a chip located in the Motherboard that stores computer data inside the chip. Computers with RAM inserted inside allows computer data to be read and written very quickly. Compared to other devices that have CR-RW's and Hard Disks, RAM is much quicker, while the speed of devices with CR-RW's and Hard Disks vary depending on the location of the device. </p></font>
       <font size= "6"><p> History: Durng the 1930's, Most of the computers were using different memory storages such as relays, mechanical counters, and delay lines, in order to help store data and memory on their computers. Eventually, The first type of RAM ever was "Williams Tube". It was created during the year 1947 and it was smaller, faster, and power-efficient. </p></font>

       <font size= "6"><p> The Hard Drive is device that is used for storing and gaining computer data by using one or more hard disks to retrieve the data. These disks are very different than your average DVD, they are coated with a magnetic material. The disk is to then be rotated with an arm within the drive and the drive reads the data from the disk like a movie DVD.</p></font>
       <font size= "6"><p> History: The very first version of the Hard Drive was in the year 1956, and they were used for most general computers to store computer data. </p></font>

       <img src= "http://www.perfectcomputerservices.com/comp_files/Computer%20Information%20Center_files/boardshot.jpg" style="width:280px;height:200px;">
       <font size= "6"><p> The BUS is basically the main circuits that are printed on every motherboard. The circuits acts as the nervous system, because they send electricity to the different parts of the motherboard in order for any of the functions to work on any motherboard. </p></font>
       <font size= "6"><p> History: Some of the earliest computers own very bulky wires that acted as the busses in order to send electricity to the components on a motherboard. Because the CPU was starting to upgrade, the busses needed to be upgraded as well, so they had to minumize the amount of space by printing the busses upon the motherboard instead of having thick wires around it. </p></font>

       <font size= "6"><p> The Keyboard is a tool that is paired with any computer and it allows the user to type in commands to the screen of a computer. The Mouse is a tool used to help select or "click" objects upon a computer screen. It also helps scroll through different websites on your computer. The Monitor is basically the main computer screen/head where the different websites appear on. </p></font>
